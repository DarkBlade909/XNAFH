XNAFH
=========

Fork of XNALara Mesh import/export tool to import For Honor .ascii files.

Original addon by XNALara community.

Main Features:
- Imports For Honor .ascii meshes with armatures
- Automatically assigns textures to each material
- Uses a custom For Honor material shader to match the in-game look

### Known Issues

- Texture paths are merely guessed based on material name. This is not perfect and there will be many failed cases. Hopefully this can be fixed in a future update.
